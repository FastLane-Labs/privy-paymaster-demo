# Zero-dev Integration with Privy

This project integrates Zero-dev's Account Abstraction infrastructure with Privy's embedded wallet solution.

## Integration Guidelines
- Privy is used for wallet creation and management
- Zero-dev is used for Account Abstraction and smart accounts
- Kernel account type is used for the smart account implementation
- All user operations are sponsored by Zero-dev's paymaster

## Important Details
- The embedded wallet from Privy serves as the base signer for the Kernel account
- Kernel client handles UserOperation creation, gas estimation, and submission
- Gas fees are covered by the Zero-dev paymaster by default
- EOA signature is generated using Privy's embedded wallet and passed to the Kernel account

## Key Components
- `useWalletManager.tsx`: Initializes the Kernel account and client
- `useTransactions.tsx`: Handles transaction operations using the Kernel client
- The integration follows Zero-dev's SDK specifications for Kernel accounts
